# BankClassify - automatically classify your bank statement entries

This code will classify each entry in your bank statement into categories such as 'Supermarket', 'Petrol', 'Eating Out' etc. It learns from previously classified data, and corrections you make when it guesses a category incorrectly, and improves its performance over time.

It is based on robintw's original project https://github.com/robintw/BankClassify to suit my own needs. As of today, I'm exporting my bank data manually.
